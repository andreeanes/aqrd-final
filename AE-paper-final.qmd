  In 2020, the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic provided a unique opportunity to study how reduced vehicle traffic may have lowered levels of air pollution in cities. Bluhm et al. (2022) explored this phenomenon throughout the state of California in light of state-wide pandemic shutdowns to determine how different demographic groups may have benefitted from this change. They found that the most historically marginalized groups (Black, Hispanic/Latinx, and low-income communities) had the highest exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrous oxides (NOx) prior to Covid-19 as the baseline scenario, and while their exposure was still among the highest during the Covid-19 shutdown period in 2020, the absolute difference in exposure to air pollution between groups was reduced. I built on these findings to further investigate this relationship with PM2.5 among highly segregated vs. more diverse communities, also finding a reduction PM2.5 exposure across groups, although the largest reductions were seen Black and some Hispanic/Latinx communities. I also analyzed how PM2.5 differed overall between years by county, which yielded mixed results but overall a small (9.9%) reduction in average PM2.5 concentrations when weighted by sensor data availability and how well it represents the county-level population. In addition, this study highlights the importance of using a diverse set of fixed effects, as was the case with Bluhm et al. (2022), to further study what factors may contribute to and confound an understanding of air pollution exposure.

# Introduction

Issues of health and equity related to air quality, particularly in urban contexts, have gained increasing attention in recent years along with the emergence of interdisciplinary environmental justice scholarship. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, provided an incredibly unique set of conditions to study how patterns of urban air pollution change in response to a sudden decrease in vehicle emissions, as well as how other contributors to air pollution may or may not follow this trend. @bluhm_disparate_2022, the focus of this paper whose findings I extend, explore this phenomenon in great detail through a two-way fixed effects analysis. They study how different demographic groups may be disproportionately impacted by air pollution, what confounding spatial and temporal variables can be accounted for in order to more accurately study such impacts, and the effects on this relationship as a result of the Covid-19 shutdown after stay-at-home orders were fully in place throughout the state of California between late March and April of 2020.

While numerous, one major finding of this study reinforced an increasingly well-understood theme in environmental justice, but with an insightful twist in light of Covid-19. This is that low-income and racially marginalized groups already experienced disproportionately high levels of air pollution - in this case, particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) - in baseline conditions prior to Covid-19, but as a result of emissions decreasing universally in most places, the level of disparity between groups in terms of the absolute concentration of pollutants decreased. While overarching differences in harmful pollution between more affluent communities and their low-income counterparts remained even during the Covid-19 shutdown (i.e., there was little change in terms of the ordinal relationship between groups), the historically worst-affected communities experienced a notable improvement in their exposure to PM2.5 and NOx. @camilleri_air_2023 analyze a similar case in Chicago, albeit in a more predictive capacity, finding that the electrification of heavy-duty vehicles would most likely provide the greatest health benefits to Black and Hispanic/Latinx communities through a relatively larger reduction in exposure to air pollution. @bluhm_disparate_2022 visualize this phenomenon in terms of the actual underlying patterns of changes in the frequency of driving ("mobility") and through a theoretical representation of exposure by demographic group in Figures 2b and ED1, respectively.

Other studies have explored various aspects of the dynamics between race, class, income, and health outcomes related to air pollution, both regarding baseline conditions Covid-19 notwithstanding as well as the specific ramifications of pandemic lock-downs. @mikati_disparities_2018 and @mohai_racial_2009 serve as prominent examples demonstrating disproportionate proximity of emissions sources and overall exposure to hazardous air pollutants among racial minorities, particularly ones which are predominantly Black and Hispanic/Latinx, as well as low-income communities. @mikati_disparities_2018 used a national point-source emissions database combined with American Community Survey (ACS) data to determine particulate matter exposure among racial groups and poverty thresholds, while both studies analyzed siting patterns of hazardous industrial facilities in relation to numerous factors, notably race, gender, age, and urban vs. rural residence. In addition to the aforementioned groups, @mohai_racial_2009 found heightened likelihood of exposure to hazardous sources of emissions among those closer to cities, living in the South or Northeast, with low educational attainment, and over the age of 65. In the context of Covid-19, @bekbulat_changes_2021 and @ali_exposure_2021, respectively, present additional evidence that most pollutants notably decreased in their concentration during the Covid-19 shutdown periods (albeit with different trends and delays), and that exposure to high concentration of particulate matter can lead to more severe Covid-19 symptoms.

@bluhm_disparate_2022 use highly complex models to fix for weather, transportation, and infrastructural components over space and time, as well as accounting for various racial and economic characteristics. Doing so served to both isolate the relationship with air pollution exposure among variables of interest (mostly demographic), as well as to reduce the influence of exogenous confounding variables. Given this complexity, accurately replicating and analyzing all fixed effects would be beyond the scope of this paper, thus requiring a narrower and/or fuzzier analysis of major variables. To differentiate from and extend upon Bluhm et al.'s findings, I have conducted a series of analyses on particulate matter exposure which narrow in on the exact period during which Covid-19 lock-down was fully implemented in California (March 20th - April 30th), along with the same dates in 2019, to elucidate a relationship between race and PM2.5 exposure. Isolating this period of relatively uniform mobility trends during the onset of Covid-19, along with a selection of days within a narrow seasonal range, effectively serves as a time fixed effect. Given this narrower period within each year, I provide further analysis and insight regarding the variance in particulate matter exposure among more racially segregated versus more diverse communities as well as the county-level trends in air pollution between years, also highlighting the challenges associated with identifying appropriate and usable temporal and geographic delineations for analysis. While all analyses were constrained to March and April of each year, geographic groupings vary between the sensor level, Census block group, county level, and state level depending on the granularity and scope required for each result.

In analyzing exposure among communities of different racial compositions, I grouped sensor particulate matter readings by year and a racial designation category associated with whether or not a particular racial group dominated each Census block, represented through @fig-dp in marginal density plots form. @fig-rd and @fig-bi show county-level PM2.5 exposure using a weighting convention based on the availability and robustness of sensor data within each county. I find that overall year-over-year changes in PM2.5 exposure were mixed, partly as a result of the chosen geographic delineations and the fuzzy nature of the analysis. However, PM2.5 was reduced on average between March-April 2019 and 2020, exhibited clear discrepancies between racial groups, and showed fewer high readings uniformly across groups, with an exception among Hispanic/Latinx populations, whose exposure assumed a bimodal distribution in 2020, with some areas showing lower PM2.5 concentrations and others showing higher exposure, likely as a result of shifting emissions patterns. This analysis highlights the clear differences in exposure among racial groups as well as the importance of incorporating fixed effects where possible to show the varied drivers of urban air pollution (including and beyond vehicle traffic) to more accurately parse out environmental-justice-critical air pollution exposure among low-income and minority racial groups, particularly given the numerous changes which can occur around a large-scale shock such as Covid-19 shutdowns.

# Data & Methods

The key variables used in this and the original study are summarized in @fig-sumtable, notably particulate matter readings, Census block-level population and racial composition, and median income. Except for PM2.5, the remaining variables were virtually unchanged between the studied periods in 2019 and 2020. All variables are derived from individual data points on the sensor- and daily-observation-level, except for county-level PM2.5 averages, which are derived from the same sensor-observation-level data but are summarized based on 56 observed counties and each year.

![Table of summary statistics, including daily and annual particulate matter (PM2.5) readings, block group populations in total and by race, compositions of various racial groups in each block group, and median income (as well as a log of income for linear comparison with PM2.5) by block group.](figures/PM_SumStatsTable.png){#fig-sumtable scale="80%" fig.pos="h" fig-align="center"}

The underlying data for this analysis were a combination of Census Bureau demographic data and particulate matter concentration data (PM2.5 µg/cubic meter), the latter of which were gathered from California Air Resources Board (CARB) professional-grade air monitors and PurpleAir units (low-cost sensors often used in domestic or educational settings). Code in the original replication package from @bluhm_disparate_2022 joins these to capture all key variables, and then creates two datasets which were directly used in this analysis, one of which lists one row per daily sensor observation (denoted as the "wide" dataset), the other of which duplicates each daily sensor observation row once for each key demographic characteristic by block (log median income, percent Black, and percent Asian, and percent Hispanic/Latinx), creating a long format dataset four times the length as the first.

I first grouped the wide data by county and year and then weighted each sensor based on the completeness of its data relative to other sensors, finally weighting counties (assigned values between 0 and 1) based on the sensor readings in each relative to the total population of the corresponding county. I then plotted these values in a pseudo-regression-discontinuity format with the weight as the running variable and average county-level PM2.5 concentrations during each March-April annual period as show in @fig-rd (weights for 2020 are flipped and put between 1 and 2 such that 1 is the cutoff between years). I then took the same data and plotted them simply by year without weights as the running variable to have a simpler binary representation of any year-over-year differences. Note that the use of weights as the running variable in this format is not conducive to a beset fit line - rather, differences are highlighted with horizontal dotted lines at the weighted mean for each year.

To create @fig-dp, I took daily-sensor-observation-level data, this time using the long format dataset, and assigned a categorical dummy variable to whether each observation is in a Census block with a majority or vast majority of a given racial group, or if no groups exceed 50% (thus, all bins are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive). With these delineations, I grouped the observations in blocks with no group exceeding 50% ("Relatively Diverse") along with those with a group exceeding 50% but not 80% ("Majority..."), and then I grouped only blocks comprised of greater than 80% of a single racial group ("Vast Majority..."). I took these groups, also separated by year, and plotted them as a marginal density plot.

Finally, I grouped the long format dataset by year and demogrpahic group, running linear regressions for each subset between PM2.5 concentration and percent composition of the chosen demographic. The estimating equation underlying the linear regression models summarized in @fig-reg-table is composed as follows: $$E_{it} = P_{is,td} + R_{ib,t}$$ where $E_{it}$ is the mean PM2.5 exposure among racial groups by each location fixed effect, categorized under denotation $_{i}$, during the late March to April period fixed effect in each year, categorized under denotation $_{t}$. $P_{is,td}$ represents the mean among PM2.5 concentrations on the daily level within each each March-April annual period, denoted as $_{td}$, at each sensor-level location, denoted as $_{is}$. $R_{ib,t}$ represents the proportion of each racial group as a percent of the total population in each Census block, denoted as $_{ib}$, during each annual March-April annual period, also denoted as $_{t}$.

# Results

The first set of figures plot county-level PM2.5 exposure during late March through April of 2019 and 2020. @fig-rd uses weights as the running variable, showing that PM2.5 did decrease consistently year-over-year, but only slightly when represented in on the county level and not accounting for a broader array of fixed effects. @fig-bi shows the same county-level averages but simply as a binary variable. Both graphs use the dotted red line to represent the weighted mean among all counties (even @fig-bi despite not using weighting as a running variable).

Red dotted lines represent weighted averages among counties for each year. While still exhibiting high variance, count-level weighted mean PM2.5 was 9.9% lower during the 2020 shutdown period than the same time in 2019.](figures/RD_CoWt_Scatterplot_19v20.png){#fig-rd scale="70%" fig.pos="h" fig-align="center"}

![Average PM2.5 concentrations by county and year, with weighting and opacity assigned equally. This shows the same distributions and weighted mean lines as @fig-rd (also a 9.9% reduction in weighted mean PM2.5), but it visualizes each county more evenly.](figures/County_Binary_Scatterplot_19v20.png){#fig-bi scale="70%" fig.pos="h" fig-align="center"}

@fig-dp breaks down Census blocks by whether they exhibited a strongly segregated racial composition and if so, by what race, faceted by year and an upper and low racial designation category (i.e., highly segregated or not). Generally, predominantly Black and Hispanic/Latinx communities experienced the highest exposure to particulate matter in both years, although there was a noticeable shift during the 2020 Covid-19 shutdown in which distributions became more closely aligned among racial groups, lowering PM2.5 exposure (especially very high concentrations values) to some degree among all groups. The only major exception to this was a contingent of Hispanic/Latinx communities, which actually experienced equal or higher exposure in 2020. It is possible that this is due to increased output from electricity generation plants, which these communities may be disproportionately sited near, or that they are already located in highly urban settings with less of a decrease in overall pollution.

Variables are grouped by racial designation category and faceted based on year and whether or not each Census block had a vast majority of one group.](figures/RaceDsgGroup_MargDensPlot_19v20+SegvDiv.png){#fig-dp fig.pos="h" fig-align="center"}

Finally, @fig-reg-table summarizes a series of linear regressions conducted by year on race, income, and year.Based on these results, low-income and predominantly Black and Hispanic/Latinx communities have the greatest association with higher exposure to high PM2.5 concentrations. This trend is weaker in 2020 compared to 2019, but the overall dynamic remains relatively similar based on this fuzzy comparison.

# Conclusion

The findings of this paper largely confirm previous studies in the field, particularly in terms of the discrepancies in particulate matter exposure between different racial and income groups. County-level analyses were mixed but found a small reduction in average exposure across the entire sampled population. When broken down by racial groups, there was a noticeable reduction in PM2.5 exposure among all groups, although the largest reductions were seen Black and some Hispanic/Latinx communities. This analysis demonstrates an important overarching dynamic at the heart of environmental justice scholarship. However, it also highlights the importance of continued study into what factors may contribute to and confound an understanding of air pollution exposure over various spatial and temporal scales.
